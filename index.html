          <p class='has-number'>
            When it comes to designing education products online, we’ve orbited the Earth a
            few times. It’s not just about great UX or efficient engineering &mdash;
            we understand the psychology of learning, customer-acquisition flows, and
            scalability. If you want the right product, built the right way, there
            isn’t a team in the galaxy more equipped than us.

            We become your remote product partner because it allows us to

            that means the best of strategy, design, and engineering for the
            whole project. Already have an internal team? No problem. Like the
            <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html'>International Cooperation</a>

        <p class='mb-2 fs-l'>
          Unlike an actual galactic mission, building digital products means we can
          iterate. Our entire process is built on ideas + execution, rapid
          iteration + measurement. We validate ideas, design solutions, deploy
          features, measure outcomes, and course correct as needed to ensure a
          sustainable, successful digital product.
